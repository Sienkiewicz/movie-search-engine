## Simple movie search engine

Ok, gays, nothing special. Just write word in search bar and woosh (if you have a fast internet) you will see cards of movies with the title witch is contain your keyword, or you'll see the massage, in case when movie with you key in title doesn't exist.

On one page you can see only 10 movies, but you cat leaf to another page, if the result is bigger then 10 movies.

On case when result contain only one page the arrow button will be disabled, so when you click on the buttons nothing will happen.

One more about the search bar - the search bar have validation: you need to type. at least, 3 letter. Before you didn't fo this - form will show you a red border, helper text and you can't press the button or when you press the Enter nothing will happen.

So, if you want to try - fill free to fork this code, pull it on your computer, and run on command line

```javascript
yarn install
```

. after thet just type on CL

```javascript
yarn start
```

and enjoy.
